Margot Robbie: great. Ryan Gosling: awesome, and arguably the best part of the movie. The scenery and props really did help create the world. The storyline started off very intriguing. However, when the movie got to the meat of the plot and the central conflict, its message became confusing. It\\'s like they wanted to make Ken the bad guy yet also sympathetic, which is not impossible or unheard of, but the way the writers did this was ineffective. Also, the resolution didn\\'t make sense based on the message and events that led up to it. Lastly, I really hate it when movies try to empower women by dumbing down the men. I get that in a Barbie world, Ken is an afterthought, but in the real world all men were also dumb. They also treated masculine qualities as \"evil.\" I hate stereotyping people, men included, and it\\'s like all men ride horses and have fragile egos and drink \"brewskies.\" And for goodness sake, if I had a dollar for every time the movie said \"patriarchy\", I\\'d be rich. So, overall, I give this movie a 6/10.']\n"
